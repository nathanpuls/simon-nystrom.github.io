<h2>Hi! ðŸ‘‹</h2>
<p>
  Welcome to my personal site. My name is Simon NystrÃ¶m and I work as a software
  engineer with a primary focus on backend Java development.
</p>
<p class="intro2">
  This site is a place for me to drop notes and write about things that I find
  interesting and want to learn more about. This means I won't always be writing
  about topics that I feel like I know everything (or even a lot) about, I may
  even sometimes write about things that aren't directly related to software
  engineering. I am likely just learning in public, thus, you are unlikely to
  find some sort of source of truth on this site. I hope my thoughts can offer
  you some assistance and/or entertainment ðŸ™‚.
